# CS-370-J7040-Current-Emerging-Trends-in-CS-23EW1

Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

I developed an intelligent agent, named Pirate, trained to navigate a maze-like treasure game. The agent's objective was to successfully reach the treasure by utilizing a deep Q-learning algorithm to determine the optimal path. I was given initial code that included the maze game environment and was responsible for implementing the learning algorithm into the designated 'TODO' section.

What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists can use the power of AI learning across various industires. Deep learning can be utilized to train non-player characters (NPCs) in video games, as well as for computer vision applications, including video and image recognition, enabling the system to identify specific objects or individuals with greater accuracy.

How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

The first step is to understand the problem by identifying its requirements and constraints. Next, I would break down the problem into smaller subproblems or components. Then, I would implement a plan or algorithm to systematically resolve the issue. After that, I'd execute the solution using a programming language based on the established framework. I would then test the solution using unit testing or static testing. During the iterative phase, I would carefully identify and address any issues, including bugs or potential algorithm biases. I would also document as much as possible, especially if a learning algorithm is used.

What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

I would ensure the protection of all user data through the implementation of robust security measures and advanced encryption techniques. Additionally, I would provide a clear and transparent outline detailing the data to be collected, as well as its intended use and storage. My aim would be to develop unbiased AI algorithms that eliminate any discrimination from the decision-making process. Furthermore, I would strictly adhere to all legal requirements, including both industry standards and government regulations.
